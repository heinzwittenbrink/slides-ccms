<h2>Document Management</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A document management system aims to digitally organize all files and documents within an organization so that they can be easily accessible and placed in a single central location. This way, information is easy to find, and the time saved can be channelled towards more essential tasks required for company operation.</p>

<h2>Component Content Management System</h2>
<p>https://www.empolis.com/blog/digitale-transformation/component-content-management/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So here is our proposed definition. I’m sure it will elicit lots of comments and maybe a few “flames”, but it provides a starting point we can work with.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Component Content Management systems manage content at a granular level (component) of content rather than at the document level. Each component represents a single topic, concept or asset (e.g., image, table). Components are assembled into multiple content assemblies (content types) and can be viewed as components or as traditional “documents”. Each component has its own lifecycle (owner, version, approval, use) and can be tracked individually or as part of an assembly. CCM is typically used for multichannel customer-facing content (marketing, usage, learning, support). CCM can be a separate system or be a functionality of another content management type (e.g., ECM or WCM).</p>

<h2>Affordances</h2>
<ul>
<li>Centralized Control</li>
<li>Content and Media Enrichment – Referential Integrity</li>
<li>Cross-functional Collaboration</li>
<li>Process Management</li>
<li>Process Integration</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Centralized Control: concentrates knowledge and enables sharing, swapping, reusing, and reviewing content. It can answer content audit questions such as, who did what, when and why did they do it, on what content did they work, and where was that content delivered. Content and Media Enrichment: helps create metadata that facilitate discovery by both CCMS users and information product users. Referential Integrity: manages and maintains the links between objects – particularly important when the content is reused in multiple documents, versions, and formats. Cross-functional Collaboration: integrates and adapts to the organization’s roles and access needs, facilitating experts’ collaboration in adding and reviewing content. Process Management: adapts and enforces the organization’s business rules and processes, including planning, translation monitoring, final processing, and output delivery. Process Integration: interfaces with delivery platforms, such as dynamic delivery systems, learning management systems, and other storage sources.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill Trippe first coined the term in a Gilbane Group Content Management Technology Whitepaper sponsored by xHive called Component Content Management in Practice. Interestingly, while he describes it and compares it to other types of content management, he never really provides a simple definition for it.</p>

<h2>Before DITA</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to expanding the types of content that are now managed, ECM has also ushered ina recognition that content management is a peer application to other kinds of enterprise applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM). (Trippe 2005)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One complex business process involves technical documentation, catalogs, and other kinds of content used in product support, where reusable content “components” can be managed in a way that complex content products can be assembled, reassembled, and published. This kind of application is especially critical in markets such as manufacturing, electronics, aviation and other transportation, and the military. (Trippe 2005)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The capital investment made by the aircraft buyers is fully realized when the aircraft is properly maintained by following a comprehensive, long-term—and content-intensive—maintenance program. (Trippe 2005, p.4)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many enterprises have the volume of content that offers re-purposing opportunities. The practice of producing multiple media formats—print, online, CD-ROM, HTML—from a single-source is well-established, but enterprises face even greater volume of content across more and more versions, channels, markets, and languages. As the enterprise’s requirements for multi-channel publishing expands, the enterprise must invest in platform architectures that can efficiently automate these processes. (Trippe 2005, p.5)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Single-source publishing involves repurposing content into other formats, but when a content component is used in www.gilbane.com5 Component Content Management in Practice multiple content types, it is called reuse. (Trippe, p. 5f)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Identifying the redundant pieces that make up the content can be thought of as one means of identifying content “components,” and is central to the reuse strategy. (Trippe, p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The key to the successful re-use of content is to manage it at a granular level. These grains of content—components—can be shared, reviewed, updated, or combined and compiled intodifferent document aggregations and collections. Each component can be separately edited and re-used, and workflow processes enforced. Content components can have their own lifecycles and properties—version, owner, and approval—that support fine-grained reuse andthe ability to track such usage. (Trippe, p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to providing a format-neutral data structure, XML encoding of the content also cansupport reuse by providing a ready mechanism for dividing the content into logical elements or components. For example, a repair manual for a transmission could be divided into the various tasks that can be performed, a parts catalog could be divided by part number, partdescription, and so on. Analysts and consultants have used terms like “minimum reusable unit” or MRU to describe the level at which content is logically stored for maximum efficiency. (Trippe, p. 7)</p>
